The Python script records WEPP model outputs for a single slope and soil condition under 29 cropping and tillage combinations and five climate scenarios, including a baseline. These scenarios were detailed in the article "Modeling Surface Runoff and Soil Loss Response to Climate Change" (Soil and Tillage Research).
